> "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination." -- Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month

Not being as eloquent as Fred Brooks, I say "Invisible Blocks: for building invisible machines", where he says "castles in the air."

I write software, for a living, and for fun. I tinker, more than toil. As professional programmers go, I have a slight bias towards math-y, computer-science-y topics, but I actually write more about how software makes you think. I also think about design (both software-specifically, and in general). I'm an auto-didact. Lately, I've been doing more and more with generative art. I also make [WordCram](http://wordcram.org).

Here are some of my posts that I think are decent, but don't get as much traffic as the more google-able ones:
