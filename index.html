        A design pattern itself won't make you a better programmer. Knowing lots of them - when to use them, and their strengths and weaknesses - will. Design patterns are experience, coalesced and distilled.

        <p>When I was first learning Ruby, one of the resources that helped me most was <a href="http://www.exampler.com">Brian Marick’s</a> “A Little Ruby, a Lot of Objects.” It’s modeled after <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer">The Little Schemer</a> (or, if you’re older, <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_little_LISPer.html?id=vbFQAAAAMAAJ">The Little LISPer</a>), but it uses Ruby, and teaches the core ideas of object-oriented programming in a way that helped me, even after I’d been doing OOP for 6 years. (I’m not surprised that his newer book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/fp-oo">Functional Programming for the Object-Oriented Programmer</a>, is just as illuminating.) The only thing I didn’t like was that it stopped after only 55 pages.</p>

  <p>…being able to do task X with 50 lines of code is preferable to needing 500 lines of code to do task X. Less code takes longer to write, but the real benefits are around maintenance: less code means less of a chance of bugs, less to keep in your head, less for someone else (or yourself 6 months later) to read through and learn, less to test, and less to modify when you change the rest of the system.</p>

One of the optimizations I made was to remember the value of each Fibonacci number:  since F(7) is always 13, instead of recalculating it each time N=7, we can stuff <em>7 -&gt; 13</em> into a look-up table for future reference. The function builds up a cheat-sheet, to avoid doing the re-work.  It remembers.</p>

They know the first word, but the second comes from a failed OCR scan.

        <p>Hacking the browser’s DOM is about traversing its structure, changing it around, and generating content.  It’s the sexy half of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">Ajax</a> – the part that changes the page <em>before your very eyes!</em>  I won’t go into Ajax here, as there are other places that cover it far better than I can.  Without Ajax’s other half, asynchronous HTTP, I’m not entirely sure how useful DOM hacking is, but it’s fun, and I’ve found at least a few good uses for it.  YMMV – others on my team find it somewhat less attractive than I do.  Along the way I’ll talk about function pointers, and throw in some recursion.</p>

        <p>I had an interesting conversation with a co-worker recently. We got to discussing a small project we were on back in January ‘05, that basically involved creating a small dynamic questioner. You configure the interview by creating questions, and each possible answer to the question leads to either another question, or an outcome. We modelled the interview as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a> (I know, you already knew about DAGs – the link is for the other readers). We built a test tool that traversed the DAG, and reported all possible paths. We even (this was pretty cool) built an importer that created interviews from <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">FreeMind</a> mind maps…basically made FreeMind our GUI. We did all this in about 3 weeks (Java and XSL, if anyone’s wondering). We had fun, and both our management and our customers loved it. It’s loads easier to change the questions now than it would’ve been if the questions were just hard-coded, the way everyone expected it to be done. I think we even beat the estimate for that approach.</p>

As he spelled out each letter, I typed it in, until he said something that sounded just like “adder-oit”. I asked him to repeat it twice, and both times, it sounded just like “adder-oit”. Oh shit, I thought, maybe it’s one of those letters that has a weird translation, and he can’t remember what it is in English. Like ‘eegreck’ in French means the letter ‘y’.

        <p>I’ve been reading and thinking more and more about off-shoring.  One thing that keeps coming up is the idea that Americans are generally more mentally flexible, or something.  People talking about off-shoring say “yes, you’ll lose your mundane jobs, your grunt-work.  But you’ll excel by being creative!  That’s what Americans are good at!”  Two pieces of the idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>We value trouble-makers.  People who say "screw off," and go do it their own way.  Cowboys, mavericks, smart-alecks, rebels, scrappy little kids. Clever, resourceful people.  Iconoclasts.  Main benefit: we feel it's a Good Thing to charge off and try something, no matter how stupid the idea seems.  We take risks, and sometimes that stupid idea pays off.  Go figure.</li>
<li>We don't have a rigid class system.  We believe, as a kind of core cultural value, that any poor bum with talent has a chance of using his talent to get rich.  Call it the American dream.  Main benefit: we believe that anyone can be rich/famous/president/CEO, so why not you?  Why can't you be C-E-freakin'-O?</li>

        <p>I’ve been working as tech. lead, going full-speed on a project since February. Last May, we learned it would be outsourced to The Vendor in India. Since my team has never outsourced anything before, we suddenly had to figure out how the whole thing would work (of course, there’s no extra time). We already did a decent amount of design work…would The Vendor repeat that work? Or would they work from what we provided them? How would they tie in to our build process? How about our internal services that use our own SOA framework? [We use proprietary, built-in-house frameworks for anything. We’re just now (yes, now) moving off our proprietary MVC framework to the latest, greatest, cutting-edge Struts 1.1 MVC framework. w00t!]</p>

        <p>In some fun work-time conversation today, my friend Tom &amp; I discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control">Computerized Numerical Control (CNC)</a> systems, and how they’re being used to turn 3D models of an object into physical sculptures. You can 3D-scan an object, tweak the model if you want, ship the digital file to one of these companies, and they ship you back a physical copy of it. There areother companies that similarly create resin sculptures from digital models.</p>

        <p>I just heard from a friend &amp; co-worker about a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400101530/amzna9-1-20/ref=nosim/104">Why Business People Speak like Idiots</a>, and a book Amazon offers with it, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0691122946/ref=pd_bxgy_img_2/">On Bullshit</a>.  These both sound pretty interesting.  They remind me of, in no particular order, Orwell’s <a href="http://orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit">“On Polictics and the English Language”</a>, <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte’s</a> work, and Strunk’s <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141">Elements of Style</a>:  all efforts to remove clutter, and leave clarity.  I think I’ll buy one and see for myself.</p>

        <p>One of Robert Glass’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321117425/amzna9-1-20/ref=nosim/104-8747188-9452743?dev-t=D26XECQVNV6NDQ%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2">Fallacies of Software Engineering</a> is that “Programming can and should be egoless.” People think that ego gets in the way of writing good software – you need to be cool, calm, and collected. No room for ego here, thanks, we’re detached professionals. Glass, though, argues that ego is part of what makes a programmer good – it provides incentive, personal attachment, motivation. Your software reflects on you, so make it good. This is all fine, and makes some sense to me. However, I want to talk about another aspect of ego that I think is less discussed, and more of a problem.</p>

        <p>Often when I suggest a better way to do things, some kind of process improvement, people say, “I think that’s an excellent idea.  Unfortunately, we’re on a very aggressive schedule.  In a perfect world, I think your idea would be a wonderful way to do things, but we just don’t have the time now.”  This is said about all kinds of reviews (requirements, design, and code), prototyping, usability testing, building strategically, unit testing…</p>

        </h2>
        <p>“The interface is the application.”  You hear that a lot when someone’s trying to remind you to consider the end-user’s perspective.  It’s a good reminder, too – to the user, the inner workings of your application are probably about as interesting as the inner workings of a warehouse.  N-tier?  Components?  Who cares?  At the end of the day, if people don’t use your software, is it really any good?</p>

        <p>Maybe this echoes back to my days making music. I remember wondering whether a band needed to have a “leader,” a single member who wrote most of the words and music, and provided a psychological unity to the band. Gave it a personality.</p>

        <p>Occasionally, when designing how software should work, the question comes up:  the existing user interface or use case is bad, and we think we can improve it.  Should we?  A change for the better is still a change – does the benefit outweigh the pain of re-learning?  Or, more pessimistically, the users are familiar with bad technology, so why bother making improvements?</p>

        </h2>
        <p>I’m reading the book <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hackpaint.html">Hackers and Painters</a>. In it, Paul Graham compares hackers (in the original sense of the word, not in the sense of people who break into things) to painters and other “makers” (composers, writers, etc). His point is that hacking is less precise, less calculated, than non-programmers probably think; that it’s more of a creative process, where a project can evolve as it progresses. [Contrast that with <a href="http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Quality/PirsigZen/part1.html">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a>: “It’s all of technology they can’t take…Sylvia’s irritation at a friend who thought computer programming was ‘creative’.”]</p>
