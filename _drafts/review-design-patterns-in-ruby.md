The patterns are presented in a sensible fashion, introducing both OO concepts and ruby syntax and semantics a bit at a time, building on what came before.

Each pattern is illustrated with ruby code written Java-style, and then a new ruby feature is explained that lets you boil it down nicely.

The examples are practical, and relate well to real-world development.  The UML is more standard, and the code samples are easier to read than the GoF's Smalltalk...but that's probably because I know ruby, and not Smalltalk.

On a side-note, this is the first book I've read all on O'Reilly's Safari.  I took a new job in March, and the company pays for my Safari.  To a scatter-brain like me, the chance to read from ten books, and not pay for, or carry, one of them, is nice.  My only gripe is that it could use a hot-key to turn the 'pages'.
