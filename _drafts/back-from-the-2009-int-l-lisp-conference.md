Well, I'm back.  It was a fantastic conference.

Hanging out in the MIT Stata Center was very cool.  

The debate on whether macros are a menace was good, especially when it veered into Gerald Sussman's explanation of why MIT no longer uses scheme as the language for their "intro to CS" course, [6.001](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-001Spring-2005/CourseHome/index.htm) (you can read [Chas' excellent summary](http://blog.snowtide.com/2009/03/24/why-mit-now-uses-python-instead-of-scheme-for-its-undergraduate-cs-program)).

Seeing [Judy the Robot](http://sgouros.com/) at the banquet was entertaining...parts of it reminded me of _<span style="font-style:normal;">[Gödel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465026567?ie=UTF8&tag=invisblock-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0465026567)</span>_[, ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465026567?ie=UTF8&tag=invisblock-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0465026567)_<span style="font-style:normal;">[Escher](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465026567?ie=UTF8&tag=invisblock-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0465026567)</span>_[, Bach](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465026567?ie=UTF8&tag=invisblock-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0465026567).

The technical papers and presentations were really good.  People are doing real work out there with Lisp, in some interesting domains:
<ul>
<li>scientific computation, for physics simulations, and restoring old films</li>
<li>recommending related books, movies, and music, based on connections between authors, actors, musicians, and technical crew</li>
<li>expert systems that decide when to apply pesticides</li>
<li>software that helps design [systems-in-package](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_in_package)</li>
</ul>

There were also a number of papers about new kinds of computation: propagators, parallelism, 

Sriram Krishnamurthi's talk on MobyScheme and the [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/) project were interesting...[see the slides, get the audio](http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Talks/Moby-Bootstrap/).  The Bootstrap project is very interesting...a project that gets kids to say "I need to learn _more math_ to make my game better" is doing something right.

It was my first sight of a lot of the Lisp community, and it was informational.  The panel discussion on the future of Lisp, "the next 50 years," seemed to revolve around the question, "do we want Lisp to be popular?"  Given [Clojure's](http://clojure.org) recent popularity, it wasn't surprising that there was some heat over whether the JVM and CLR were worth notice.  There seems to be some particular sources of anti-Java prejudice out there, and elitism.

I'll post links here as I learn of materials coming on-line.
