Reg Braithwaite continues to give me hope:  [Business programming standards have become higher in 2007. Learn to love it.](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/business-programming-standards-have.html)

The software world offers many interesting problems to solve.  Unfortunately, we have to wade through all the nasty little problems, and as Paul Graham [warns](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html), "The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you don't learn anything from them...working on nasty little problems makes you stupid."  In that case, we should follow [Steve Yegge's advice](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/12/i-take-it-all-back-send-me-your-money.html):  "Never stop learning...every program you write should be the hardest you've ever written."  Avoid the nasty little problems, work on the really tough ones.  Got it.

But how do we find these tough problems?  How do we avoid the [accidental difficulties](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/10/12.html), and work on the [actual difficulties](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/09/business-programming-simply-isnt-that.html)?  It's not that we can't tell them apart -- that's easy -- but how do we find people who will pay us to solve them?  If I knew that, I'd be a much happier coder.

One common variety of nasty-little-problem is working in the wrong context.  When the problem you're working on just isn't handled well by your area of expertise, but is handled beautifully by another.

This usually manifests as lots of dull, manual work, to achieve very little.  Writing a hundred data-mapping objects, instead of generating them from the database schema.  Even typing manually, instead of learning how to use search-and-replace efficiently.

Maybe the least-appreciated benefit of Ruby on Rails is that it wipes out a _whole category_ of accidental difficulties, clearing out the mess.

It's really aggravating when you see a program that's messy because a [Blub programmer](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) didn't know there was a better way.  The worst part is championing the different approach, and getting beaten back with scheduling.  "Well, sure, we could do that, if we had lots of extra time...but it works ok now, and I don't have time to get into that new, weird stuff."

So many hard problems are hard only because you're looking at it the wrong way.  But once you know the trick, it's easy...and sooner or later, ya gotta figure everyone's gonna know the trick.  Do you want to be the only one left out?  Do you really want to be the only one still struggling with old problems?

If Reg is right, that 2007 is the year Business Programming gets tougher
