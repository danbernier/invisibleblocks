Cosmic Wimpout is a really fun dice game. The rules are very easy, once you've learned them, but they're hard to explain. Watching people try, several times, has led me to conclude:
<ul>
<li>**The more often a rule comes into play, the earlier you should explain it**
or</li>
<li>**Explain exceptions last**</li>
</ul>

Here's my shot at explaining Cosmic Wimpout:
<ul>
<li>You have 5 6-sided dice.  They have a 5 and a 10, as digits, and symbols for 2, 3, 4, and 6.</li>
<li>Throw the dice.  You score 5 points for any 5s, 10 points for 10s, and no points for symbols.</li>
<li>If you throw dice, and don't score on any of them, your turn ends, and you lose all the points you earned that turn.</li>
<li>If you score on at least one die, you can re-roll the rest for more points. Or you can stop, and put your points "on the board". You need at least 35 points on the board to stop.</li>
<li>If you score with all 5 dice, you keep those points, and then you <span class="caps">MUST</span> re-throw them all.</li>
<li>If you roll 3 of a kind (digit or symbol), it's called a "flash". You score 10 times the value: so 3 2s = 20 points, 3 5s = 50 points, etc. You then **must** "clear the flash"—roll the non-scoring dice until none of them come up with the flashed value—and score the roll normally: points for 5s and 10s, no points for symbols. If you roll no points after clearing a flash, you still lose all the points for that turn.</li>
<li>If you roll 5 of a kind, it's a "freight train," and you get 100 times the value. 2 exceptions: if you roll 5 6's, you win the game, instantly; if you roll 6 10's, a "supernova", you are instantly out of the game. It's "Too Many Points".</li>
<li>4 of the dice are white; the 5th is black, and has a sun instead of the 2. The sun is wild, and can count as any symbol or number, but if you roll a pair and the sun, the sun **must** count as that value, to form the flash.</li>
</ul>

A few things to notice:
<ul>
<li>I explained the "wild" flash rule last, because it only applies to flashes. Most people I've watched explain the flash when they describe the dice, but it doesn't really matter until then.</li>
<li>I explained the "flash" later than most people.</li>
</ul>

There is a connection here to software. Software emulates concepts, and lets users manipulate those concepts. Files, email, documents, URLs (delicious, reddit, digg), songs (iTunes), etc. To explain the software, what it is, and what it lets you do, you first have to explain the concepts, then the ways they can be manipulated. Starting with the manipulations, and explaining the concepts along the way, will probably be confusing.
