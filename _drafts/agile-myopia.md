NPR recently aired [a piece on the Long Now Foundation and the 10,000 year clock](http://www.npr.org/2013/12/31/258548386/10-000-year-old-clock-challenges-approach-to-time) that got me thinking about Agile, and how focusing only on what's immediately actionable can make us myopic.

Don't misunderstand - I've worked in waterfall enterprises. I've spent 3 months listening in on requirements meetings, and then had to spend 3 months designing the full application in Visio. I grok the value of Agile.

But I've worked on Agile teams that had no vision, no vivid goal. You lose steam, your energy dissipates as progress becomes monotonous. Each story you finish is another aimless step through the salt flat. It's like playing [The Stanley Parable](http://www.stanleyparable.com/).

Agile was a reaction against waterfall, a necessary course correction.
