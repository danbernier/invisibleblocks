Do companies WANT smart developers?  Does yours?  Or do they just want drones, swappable cogs, blub-programmers?

If your company _does_ want smart developers, why?  Do you hire the best you can, and then mis-manage them into insanity?  Do you let them use the brains you purportedly hired them for?

Or do you give them goals and priorities, and let them get there?  Do you let them steer the business?  Do you let them fix up the software, when they say it's needed?  Do you involve them in evaluating the trade-offs between new features and refactoring?
