Why coding standards?  Why not code reviews?

A coding standard, like grammar check in MS Word, makes you follow the rules, but can't help you do quality work.  A code review, like any peer or mentor review, helps you do quality work, by the benefit of another perspective.  It also creates a culture, a set of conventions, through shared knowledge.

If programmers were alpha-hackers, no coding standards would be necessary, but code reviews would still be useful for teams.
