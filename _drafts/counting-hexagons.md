## I don't think I should publish this, until I can figure out what I'm really contributing.  Is it just the paper?  Then a short post will do.


If you arrange hexagons (or circles) in a honey-comb pattern, in a hexagon shape, how do you find the total number of hexagons by counting the number along one edge?

[<img class="alignnone" title="Circles in a hexagon pattern" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1367/1344221289_67dd12bb87.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1367/1344221289_67dd12bb87.jpg)

That hex has 5 circles on an edge, and  61 circles total.  What's the relationship?

Of course the answer is out there somewhere on [mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CirclePacking.html) or [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing), but I wanted to find it myself: play with the problem, walk around it, look at it, try different approaches, and solve it myself.  Get the shape of the problem [in my head](http://www.paulgraham.com/head.html).  It was a fun way to spend a couple of hours.

Working on the problem like this reminded me of [A Mathematician's Lament](http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf), an essay that says we teach math the wrong way -- we make kids memorize formulas, but we should teach them to solve problems, and to judge solutions. Show them they can solve well-known problems on their own, give them a feel for how different approaches affect the solution: let them develop a sense of aesthetics.  Instead of a dry, rigid, already-charted mathematics, show them a rich, subjective, contextual one.

This article often comes to mind when I think about software.  How solution 

"By concentrating on what, and leaving out why, mathematics is reduced to an empty shell. The art is not in the 'truth' but in the explanation, the argument."

The author, Paul Lockhart, is a research mathematician, and K-12 math teacher.

At times, it can go a bit far. Some parts are written as a dialogue between Simplicio, the conservative pragmatist, and Salviati, the idealistic, enthusiastic reformer:
<blockquote>
SIMPLICIO:  It seems like we'd be taking an awful risk.  What if we de-emphasize arithmetic so much that our students end up not being able to add and subtract?

SALVIATI:  I think the far greater risk is that of creating schools devoid of creative expression of any kind, where the function of the students is to memorize dates, formulas, and vocabulary lists, and then regurgitate them on standardized tests—"Preparing tomorrow's workforce today!"</blockquote>

But the main point is good, and anyway, it's worth reading something you disagree with now and then.
