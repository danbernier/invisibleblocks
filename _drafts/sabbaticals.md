We talked about sabbaticals at work recently.  I'd love to take a bunch of time off from work, to learn about things.  A sabbatical would be a huge job perk for me...I can't see myself ever leaving a job with a sabbatical,  not for money, technology, or almost anything else.

If I had two months sabbatical, I'd pick functional programming languages that support metaprogramming, and have web frameworks:  Haskell and HAppS, Scala and lift, Erlang and ErlyWeb.  Ruby and Rails, too, of course, and maybe Python and Django or something, but I'm looking for languages that are functional first, OO second.

I think functional programming gives us better ways to [factor](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/03/why-why-functional-programming-matters.html) our problems, and to solve them.  Metaprogramming lets us build up our own abstractions, put our own concepts into the language.

What do you think of my ideas for a sabbatical?  What would you do with your sabbatical?  I'd love to hear from any practicing professionals who have sabbaticals.  How did you get it?  What do you spend them on?  How does your boss justify it to himself/herself?  Were you already a well-known rock-star programmer?  If you were, did that help?
