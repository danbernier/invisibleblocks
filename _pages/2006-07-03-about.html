  content: Hi Dan! As a newcomer to your blog, what posts do you recommend reading
    to a person in my position? I stumbled upon your post concerning finding out an
    average without using the sum of values.

<blockquote>"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination." -- Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month</p></blockquote>
<p>Not being as eloquent as Fred Brooks, I say "Invisible Blocks: for building invisible machines", where he says "castles in the air."</p>
<p>I write software, for a living, and for fun. I tinker, more than toil. As professional programmers go, I have a slight bias towards math-y, computer-science-y topics, but I actually write more about how software makes you think. I also think about design (both software-specifically, and in general). I'm an auto-didact. Lately, I've been doing more and more with generative art. I also make <a href="http://wordcram.org">WordCram</a>.</p>
<p>Come see me at a <a href="http://newhaven.io">newhaven.io</a> meetup.</p>
