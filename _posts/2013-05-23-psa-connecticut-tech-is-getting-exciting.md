[New Haven Ruby](http://www.meetup.com/newhavenrb/) is going strong, and New Haven JavaScript is heating up fast. We had a great turnout last night, with about 40 people at the [Digital Surgeons](http://www.digitalsurgeons.com/) office, and some great talks. Meet-ups are full of energy, introductions, and catching up with friends. And, obviously, tech talk.

A [broader New Haven tech community](http://www.newhaven.io/) is emerging, combining NH.rb and NH.js with [The Grove](http://grovenewhaven.com/),  [Independent Software](http://www.indie-soft.com/), and now the [A100 Developer Community](http://www.meetup.com/a100-dev-community/).

The [Greater Hartford ACM chapter](https://ctacm.wordpress.com) is spinning up, and doing very well so far, hosting talks and tours of Connecticut technology centers. [Hartford JavaScript](http://hartfordjs.com) is starting and [Hartford Ruby](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/hartford-ruby-brigade) is making a come-back (which [I'm especially happy to see](http://invisibleblocks.com/category/hartford-ruby-brigade/)).

Connecticut hackers are doing some great things. Come out and join us!
