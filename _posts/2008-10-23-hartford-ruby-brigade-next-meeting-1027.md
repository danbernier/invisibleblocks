The [Hartford Ruby Group](http://groups.google.com/group/hartford-ruby-brigade) is meeting this Monday, 10/27, at 6:00 PM.

We'll be tackling a [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com) problem, pairing up newcomers with veterans, and we'll be raffling off a copy of [Design Patterns in Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321490452?tag=invisblock-20), by Russ Olsen.

GeeZeo offices
750 Main St, Hartford
Suite 1314
(next to the CVS)

Thanks to GeeZeo for hosting us, to Sun for feeding us, and to Addison Wesley for giving us books to raffle off. Â Hope to see you there!
