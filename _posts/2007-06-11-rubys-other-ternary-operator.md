  content: "This is a well known Ruby trick, but it is not exactly the same thing
    as the ternary operator. Let's compare:\r\n\r\na ? b : c\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n(a
    &amp;&amp; b) || c\r\n\r\nThe former gives b whenever a is truthy and c otherwise,
    always. So if a == true, b == nil, and c == 'cee-threepio', (a ? b : c) =&gt;
    nil.\r\n\r\nBut (a &amp;&amp; b) || c =&gt; 'cee-threepio' for the same values.\r\n\r\nI
    prefer this form as well, but only when I know that the value of 'b' is guaranteed
    to be truthy."

  content: "You don't need the parantheses around your third and fourth lines. It
    works anyway:\r\n\r\n<code>irb(main):001:0&gt; a = true ? \"a\" : \"b\"\r\n=&gt;
    \"a\"\r\nirb(main):002:0&gt; b = false ? \"a\" : \"b\"\r\n=&gt; \"b\"\r\nirb(main):003:0&gt;
    a = true &amp;&amp; \"a\" || b\r\n=&gt; \"a\"\r\nirb(main):004:0&gt; b = false
    &amp;&amp; \"a\" || b\r\n=&gt; \"b\"\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nHowever, if you change
    &amp;&amp; to \"and\", you start running into dark corners of operator precedence:\r\n\r\n<code>irb(main):001:0&gt;
    a = true ? \"a\" : \"b\"\r\n=&gt; \"a\"\r\nirb(main):002:0&gt; b = false ? \"a\"
    : \"b\"\r\n=&gt; \"b\"\r\nirb(main):003:0&gt; a = true and \"a\" || b\r\n=&gt;
    \"a\"\r\nirb(main):004:0&gt; b = false and \"a\" || b\r\n=&gt; false\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnd
    why do you put \"var\" before user_name? Ruby isn't javascript."

    I included them to emphasize the grouping, for clarity.\r\n\r\n&gt; And why do

    think that 'var' snuck in from the javascript I've been doing, and the Scala I've

  content: i think that's how python programmers tried to get the convenience of the
    ternary operator into their programming language before they got their chainable
    syntax in version 2.5.  back then, their version also failed when the variable
    wasn't "truthy-worthy".

  content: I think the ternary operator sucks. Ok, it's fairly easy to understand
    a, b and c, but when that involves more complex expressions, it's a pain. And
    there are those who like to put a ternary operator inside another operator...

  content: Do you honestly think your expression is more readable than the ternary
    operator which is in use in many other languages?  The point is to write re-usable
    code that can be read and understood clearly, not to make things harder to read
    because you want to show you are smarter.

    precisely correct - using (unnecessary) brackets to make things clear:\r\n  whereas

This may be a well-know Ruby trick, but I thought I'd share it anyway.

Ruby has the ternary operator:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
a = true  ? 'a' : 'b' #=> "a"
b = false ? 'a' : 'b' #=> "b"{% endhighlight %}

But it also has something else...

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
a = (true  && 'a') || b #=> "a"
b = (false && 'a') || b #=> "b"{% endhighlight %}

All statements in Ruby return the value of the last expression evaluated, so `true && 'a'` returns 'a', and the 'b' is ignored (via boolean short-circuiting).  `false && 'a'` evaluates to `false`, so Ruby moves on, and returns 'b'.

&nbsp;

This is a lot like the `a ||= 'a'` trick, which expands to `a = a || 'a'`, giving the variable a default value, if it's not already initialized.

If Ruby already has the ternary operator, why bother?  Personally, I find this form more natural (which surprised me, after years of using the ternary operator in Java and C#).  For some reason, it reads more like natural language to me.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
user_name = (user.authenticated? && user.name) || 'guest'{% endhighlight %}

Does anyone else see it?
