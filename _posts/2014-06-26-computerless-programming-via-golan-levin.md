Golan Levin has posted his [notes from the Code+Ed Session](http://www.flong.com/blog/2014/computing-without-computers/) on 2014-06-10 at the Eyeo Festival, on computing without computers.

The post is basically a list of links, but it's a great starting place for algorithmic drawing - a whole section is dedicated to it. Instead of using math and software to generate drawings, people use pen and paper, or tape and floor.
