I just published my first "official" gem, [ermahgerd](https://rubygems.org/gems/ermahgerd), and what an auspicious way start my gem-author career! ERMAHGERD,Â I'M A RERL RERBER PRERGRERMAHR!

It's (currently) totally based on J Miller Design's translator, but there are some bits I'd like to tweak. We'll see, it's just for fun.

Get started with ERMAHGERD:
<pre>
$ gem install ermahgerd
$ irb
ruby-1.9.3-p0 :001 > require 'ermahgerd'
 => true 
ruby-1.9.3-p0 :002 > Ermahgerd.translate("Goosebumps, my favorite books!")
 => "GERSBERMS, MAH FRAVRIT BERKS!" 
</pre>
