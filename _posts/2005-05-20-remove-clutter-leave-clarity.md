I just heard from a friend & co-worker about a book called [Why Business People Speak like Idiots](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400101530/amzna9-1-20/ref=nosim/104), and a book Amazon offers with it, [On Bullshit](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0691122946/ref=pd_bxgy_img_2/).  These both sound pretty interesting.  They remind me of, in no particular order, Orwell's ["On Polictics and the English Language"](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit), [Edward Tufte's](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) work, and Strunk's [Elements of Style](http://www.bartleby.com/141):  all efforts to remove clutter, and leave clarity.  I think I'll buy one and see for myself.
