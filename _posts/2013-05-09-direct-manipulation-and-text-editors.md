  content: I use the AquaMacs Emacs variant, which neatly combines mac UI conventions
    and shortcuts (using the command key) and conventional emacs ones (using option
    for meta and control for control). I mix and match the UI conventions as they
    occur to me, having more than one means I have larger targets to hit, in a sense.

Hat-tip to [Giles Bowkett](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com) for mentioning Bret Victor's talk, [Stop Drawing Dead Fish](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2013/05/stop-drawing-dead-fish.html), about direct manipulation and computer interaction as a tool for illustrators and animators.

I paused this video part-way through, so I could Get Down to Work. I paused it around 34:30, right after Bret Victor mentioned [David Hestenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hestenes)' idea that algebra and geometry help us model the world in similar ways, but that algebra uses our linguistic ability, while geometry uses our visual/spatial perception. Victor went on to say that tools for visual artists should use our visual/spatial abilities (direct manipulation), rather than our linguistic ones (code).

Like I said, it was time to Get Down to Work. I flipped over to Sublime Text 2, where I happened to have a block of text selected. Warming up, I idly hit command-I to search for a bit of text, only to realize that Sublime was _only searching in that selected text._ This is handy! I've been wanting something like this lately, when a method or variable name shows up all over the file, but I'm only working on one method.

Using the trackpad to select a bunch of text, and then working on it, feels a lot like I'm holding the text in one hand, and working on it with Sublime in the other. I discovered this accidentally, too - I've felt pretty productive with Sublime after the (tiny) initial bump, and I occasionally, gradually, get better as I learn new tricks.

I switched to Sublime after trying to learn Vim for a month or so. I'd been an emacs user for a few years, but I was under-using it, and didn't need all the extra machinery. Vim seemed lighter, so I tried it out. But it felt like learning emacs all over again, but with different incantations: everything forced into the keyboard. And I get that! I'm a home-row [Dvorak typist]({% post_url 2006-12-31-dvorak-the-betamax-keyboard %})! But I still felt like emacs and vim were a step back from humbler tools like [Programmer's Notepad](http://www.pnotepad.org).

Bret Victor's talk suggests an interesting explanation for that. He points out that some animations are a pain to create manually, and some behaviors are hard to code into the tool: so you divide and allocate tasks to the computer and the artist according to their abilities, and their cooperation produces the best effect.

Maybe this explains the appeal of these less-hardcore text editors. Sure, using the mouse and buttons for everything, a la Microsoft Word, is tedious, but so is forcing all interaction through the keyboard. Maybe a better allocation of tasks, a better balance of responsibilities between typist and tool, is what's needed.
