This June brought a pleasant surprise: my effusive
[review](/2013/12/31/book-review-the-information-by-james-gleick/) of James
Gleick's [_The Information_](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781400096237)
brought me to the attention of Jimmy Soni, co-author of the new Claude Shannon
biography, _A Mind at Play_. He sent me an early copy of their book, gratis, in
exchange for an honest review. Here it is.

_A Mind at Play_ is a warm introduction to Claude Shannon. Like any good
biography, it contextualizes its subject and his work, while introducing us to
the person as well.

It's not a bad introduction to information theory, either. The authors admit
they're not mathematicians or engineers, but for that, the explanations aren't
bad. (I quibbled with some of their analogies, but not enough to go into here.)
If you want a really thorough pop-science/pop-math treatment of information
theory, pick up James Gleick's [_The
Information_](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781400096237), but Soni and
Goodman explain it more than well enough for a biography - if this book is all
you read about it, you'll understand what it's about, why it's important, and
how Shannon contributed to it. Of course if you're feeling more adventurous,
Shannon's [seminal
paper](http://worrydream.com/refs/Shannon%20-%20A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Communication.pdf)
is pretty readable, and it was expanded into [a
book](http://www.powells.com/book/mathematical-theory-of-communication-9780252725487/66-0)
with some contextualization for a broader audience.

The book's title hints at its core conceit, that Shannon's genius was rooted in
his sense of play. It repeats the commonplace of the genius caricature: he
works on whatever he wants, mostly impractical silly stuff, because his
brilliance refuses to be bound by convention or common sense; he cares little for money, reward, or fame. They illustrate this with some
entertaining stories - Shannon unicycling through the halls of MIT, or building a calculator that
operates in Roman Numerals - but it feels like the authors try to wring too
much out of it.  For me, it's enough that Shannon was brilliant and playful;
I don't need to mine that for a grand theory of genius. (If you'd like to hear Shannon's thoughts
on creative thinking, I found [his notes for a lecture he gave]({{ site.baseurl
}}/assets/2017/08/ShannonCreativeThinking.pdf) on that subject.)

Some of the Shannon stories here are well-known - particularly the ones about
his inventions, since the invention itself is most of the story anyway. But
what is probably new from this book is that the authors interviewed Shannon's
family and colleagues, giving us a much deeper look at Shannon's personality.
For instance, Shannon was married twice, and each courtship lasted only months.
Or that Shannon disliked to travel, and was not an adventurous eater, but when
he was offered awards and lectures across the globe, he would accept, partly
because his wife loved to see the world.

Bottom line: it's a good look at part of the 20th century, at the math and
technology that underpin the 21st, and one of the lives that shaped it.
