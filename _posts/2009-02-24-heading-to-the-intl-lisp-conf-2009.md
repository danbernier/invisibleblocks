My next step on [the road to lisp](http://www.google.com/search?q=the+road+to+lisp) is at the [International Lisp Conference](http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/2009/index) in Cambridge, MA, this March.

A lot of people are surprised to hear I'm interested in Lisp, but I've been studying scheme informally for about 3 years, reading [SICP](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262011530?ie=UTF8&tag=invisblock-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262011530), and finishing [The Little Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262560992?ie=UTF8&tag=invisblock-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262560992) last year.  I've been interested in [clojure](http://clojure.org) for about 18 months, especially after [seeing Rich Hickey talk about it last March](http://news.e-scribe.com/411).  Now I'm studying it in earnest with Stu Halloway's [Programming Clojure](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356336?ie=UTF8&tag=invisblock-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=1934356336).

I don't use lisps of any sort at work, so it's not a "practical" language to study like, say, C# is.  But that's short-term thinking.  Learning lisp is plenty practical, if you're looking longer-term -- even if it's only three years out.  Learning lisp teaches you about some of the core issues of programming.

I like learning lisp because it's a window into the workings of programming languages, being so close to the AST.  I want to learn more about meta-programming with macros, hygienic or not.

And for the record, the functional techniques in [The Little Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262560992?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=invisblock-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0262560992) have improved my Ruby, JavaScript, and C# in some really [solid](http://notes-on-haskell.blogspot.com/2007/02/whats-wrong-with-for-loop.html) [ways](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/03/why-why-functional-programming-matters.html). Functional programming is making its way to the rest of the programming world, and lisp does functional programming.

If you'll be at the conference, I'd love to hear from you.
