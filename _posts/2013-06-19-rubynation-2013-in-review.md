[RubyNation 2013](http://www.rubynation.org/) is done! Outside of un-confs like BarCamp, it was the first conf I've presented at. I was nervous, so I kept practicing and smoothing [the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/danbernier/object-functional-fusion-in-ruby), and I think that helped a lot - everyone seemed to like the talk. Thanks again to everyone who came to hear it!

RubyNation was a smaller conference. Someone said they felt as though you could almost talk to every attendee, or at least recognize them all by face. It felt comfortable and familiar. But I think there was more to that than just being small - I think the organizers made some particular choices that made it that way.

First, rather than rows of chairs, they provided banquet-style round tables with about 10 chairs each. This is really good for getting people talking: you have a handful of neighbors, and you're all facing each other. It's much more social than 2 neighbors and the back of someone's head. It does mean that half the table has to turn around to watch the talks, but in practice, it wasn't a problem. Whatever extra floor space the round tables took up was worth it.

Second, rather than catering lunch, each conf organizer paired with a speaker to lead the way to a different nearby restaurant. Attendees got to pick which group they would go with. Splitting into so many groups meant there was a good chance you'd eat your lunch chatting with a speaker or organizer. It also meant you had much more choice over what to eat. (Remember RailsConf 2012, when they served pot pies every single day?)

[Rails Girls DC](http://railsgirls.com/dc) was there in force. I'm not sure, but I think this was the first time RubyNation was paired with a Rails Girls DC training day. It was great to see so many people new to the community, discovering ruby and programming, and I think the variety of talks must have complemented the more-focused training day very well.

For a first-time speaker, it was a very welcoming, laid-back group - though, as Sandi Metz helpfully warned me ahead of time, they might not laugh too loudly at your jokes. If you've never given a talk at a conference, try starting with RubyNation.
