  content: Hey Dan - thanks for the shout-out on the SuperCollider stuff.  Having
    worked with ChucK in the past, I can promise you moving to SC3 is in your future.  ;)  I
    see you are in the Haven as well.  We should get together at MakeHaven sometime
    for an audio-visual live jam.  I know a couple other people who do SC3 around
    town, but not so many who do Processing.

    having through NewHaven.io, too: http://www.meetup.com/newhavenio/events/168182842/
    A SuperCollider demo would go down well.'

  content: Sounds like a good idea.  I gave a couple demos at both MakeHaven and Yale
    last semester.  Seems like meetup.com has been DDos'ed.  Hopefully it will be
    back up soon.

Scott Petersen has put together three tutorials on getting started with [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/):

* [Installing SuperCollider on Ubuntu](http://scacinto.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/new-supercollider-on-xubuntu/)
* [Installing SuperCollider on CrunchBang](http://scacinto.wordpress.com/2014/02/06/2294/) (or #! as its fans like to call it)
* [Intro to SuperCollider 3 for the Uninitiated](http://scacinto.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/intro-to-supercollider-3-for-the-uninitiated/), where he walks through SuperCollider's capabilities & updates.

I've been reading the new Manning book on [ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), titled  [Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists](http://www.manning.com/kapur/), but I think ultimately I want to head to SuperCollider, and play more with [overtone](http://overtone.github.io/).
