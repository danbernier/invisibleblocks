The [New Haven ruby group](http://newhavenrb.org) is gonna start building some rhythm, meeting twice every month, on the first Thursday and the third Wednesday. Even months (June, August, October) are hack-nights; odd months are social nights.

We had our [first one last Thursday](http://www.meetup.com/newhavenrb/events/67147902/), at the [SeeClickFix](http://seeclickfix.com) offices, and had a great turn out - about 15 people! Even [Denis](http://twitter.com/jumph4x) came out to join us. We were hacking on web apps for coordinating tasks, on ruby for reformatting _other_ ruby, and some of us were just discovering programming for the first time.

Our [next one is Wednesday, June 20th](http://www.meetup.com/newhavenrb/events/68306772/), and will again be at SeeClickFix, where free parking is just around the corner, and good pizza delivers. New Haven's newest hackerspace, [MakeHaven](http://makehaven.org/), is _also_ around the corner, and there's talk of doing a visit at some point. I'll be there, probably hacking on an app for printing fliers for user groups, or an IRC bot for the group, or a regular expression parser, or some [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems.

Hope to see you there!
