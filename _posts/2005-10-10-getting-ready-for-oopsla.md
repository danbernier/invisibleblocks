I have no idea what I'm in for, since this is my first conference.  I signed up for two [DesignFest](http://www.oopsla.org/2005/ShowEvent.do?id=804) sessions.  I asked for the on-line image management problem and the teamwork software for children's physical therapists...I only hope the groups I'm in are forgiving, because I expect I'll be like that kid brother you used to let tag along.  :shrug:  We'll see how it goes.

A lot of the talks sound good.  I'll post most of my thoughts here -- I have to gather them all for a Conference Attendance Presentation paper (due something like two days after I get back to work), and this should be a nice place to start collecting them.

Maybe I'll see you there.
