This weekend, I'll be giving a talk at RubyNation 2013, titled "Object-Functional Fusion in Ruby."

While Ruby is a great object-oriented language, its functional aspects are a bit less-appreciated. But it's no Haskell: if you try to go full-on-functional, you'll run into headache and heartache. I want to talk about some ways to fuse the two approaches.

Come say hello!
