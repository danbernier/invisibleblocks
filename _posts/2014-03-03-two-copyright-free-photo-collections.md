[I'm always looking for interesting photos to hack on]({% post_url 2013-12-17-circle-pictures %}), so I was glad to find these two sources of free images, both via [Vormplus](http://vormplus.be/blog/).

[New Old Stock](http://nos.twnsnd.co/): "vintage photos from the public archives free of known copyright restrictions." Old photos with the fuzzy haze you'd expect. Some have no indication of age besides the color fading, but [others](http://24.media.tumblr.com/70ef2f0668872fcc6df9f84b6f55e91b/tumblr_mztrt3pFAO1sfie3io1_1280.jpg) have elements that clearly mark them as old.

[Unsplash](http://unsplash.com/): "Free (do whatever you want) hi-resolution photos.  10 new photos every 10 days." You can subscribe via email, too.
