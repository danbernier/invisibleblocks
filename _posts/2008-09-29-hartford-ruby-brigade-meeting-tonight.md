  content: "Ah, that's too bad!  No, the Meetup closed last month.  It was pretty
    much defunct since February, which is why we started the Google Group meetings
    in March.  We pretty much run the group through there now, and it's the best place
    to catch word of our meetings: http://groups.google.com/group/hartford-ruby-brigade\r\n\r\nHope
    you can make it to one!"

If you're in the area, feel free to drop in:

The Hartford Ruby Brigade's September meeting is tonight, from 6 to 8 PM, at [GeeZeo's](https://www.geezeo.com/) offices on [750 Main St, Suite 1314, in Hartford](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=750+main+st+hartford+ct&ie=UTF8) (next to the CVS).

The big news is Addison Wesley has a ticket for the [Voices That Matter: Professional Ruby Conference](http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/) this November, and we'll raffle it off.  It looks like a sweet conference, go take a look.  You have to be there to win, so if you've been waiting for the right time to make an appearance, this is it.  And since only one of us can win the ticket, we'll also raffle off a great Ruby book, Hal Fulton's [The Ruby Way](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Way-Second-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0672328844).  A big thanks to Addison Wesley!

[Aaron](http://rubydoes.net/) will give his long-promised IronRuby talk, and I'll show a mini-project of mine that generates MSWord .docs from [Textile](http://textism.com/tools/textile), with [RedCloth](http://redcloth.org).  It's flashy, I promise.

Remember, if you have a topic you'd like to talk about, or one you'd like to hear about, or even if you just have an idea for what to do for the evening, don't be shy, speak up!  The group is what we make it, and it belongs to all of us.

As always, we'll have free pizza and soda, courtesy of Sun Microsystems.

Hope to see you there!
