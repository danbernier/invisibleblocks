This April 21, in Google's Manhattan offices, for $100, you can check out the [Gotham Ruby Conference](http://www.goruco.com).

These [regional Ruby conferences](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/conferences/) are a great idea, I think.  If your job won't pay for you to attend a huge (more expensive) Ruby conference, plus travel expenses, you can take advantage of the smaller, cheaper, local conferences springing up all around.  Even if you're a relative Ruby newbie, the price makes it a low-risk investment.  For $100, and a full day of Ruby, it's a bargain.  Just as a cost comparison, I'm about to start another day of .Net training, and that costs about $500 a day.

See you there...
