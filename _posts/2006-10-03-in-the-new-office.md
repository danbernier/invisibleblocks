  content: James, your comment was marked as spam...I didn't even see it until just
    now.  That's what you get for putting the word "dirty" in a comment, I guess...  =)

My company moved its office last week -- this is our first week at home in the new digs.  My desk is against a great brick wall, and next to a window _that actually opens!_  I have a great view of Talcott Mountain, which should soon start turning to fall colors.

<div class='gallery'>

</div>

Shameless bragging aside, now that the move's finished, I'm about ready to get a new post up.  The next one will be about arguing (or debating) on the job.
