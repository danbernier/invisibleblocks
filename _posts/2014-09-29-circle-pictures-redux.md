Back in December, I posted some images I'd made by dropping non-overlapping circles on an image, larger or smaller based on the brightness of the underlying pixel at that spot. I called them [Circle Pictures]({% post_url 2013-12-17-circle-pictures %}).

At the time, I was happiest with the black-and-white images; I liked the color ones less. I think I've figured out how to make the color images work better; a lot of it comes down to picking the right kind of image to start with. (High-contrast images of recognizable objects works well, especially [isolated images](https://www.google.com/search?q=isolated+banana&tbm=isch).) I also used a broader range of circle sizes, added borders, and played with how the circle size is decided: based on brightness, or saturation, or the amount of blue...any data in the pixel is fair game. The code is basically the same, so I won't bother re-posting it.

Here are some of the results, including a repeat of the sunflower images. I'll be showing prints of some of these, and some others like them, at [City Wide Open Studios](http://www.cwos.org/) at the Armory space, October 11 and 12, if you'd like to see them up-close.
