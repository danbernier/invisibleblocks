Time for a new look!  After reading about [Nifty Corners](http://pro.html.it/articoli/id_599/idcat_31/pag_1/pag.html), I decided it was time to go for that simpler, cleaner look I wanted.  It's still a bit bumpy, and I'm working things out slowly.  If you see something amiss, or even if you love/hate the new look, feel free to let me know...

Update:  Scratch that.  That was a bad idea.  Let's see if these colors are less offensive.
