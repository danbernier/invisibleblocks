  content: Actually people not using your computer because of its keyboard could be
    seen as a benefit ;-) And no, it is not better in *nix, each app will hold its
    own settings.

  content: "Aníbal, that's occurred to me, believe me.  In practice, though, it just
    gets irritating.\r\n\r\nIt's too bad that Dvorak support is so poor.  It seems
    like it could be much better, especially since the Dvorak Assistant works so well.
    \ Just confirms that Dvorak is a niche interest -- most people don't care, so
    the feature is poor, until someone who <i>does</i> care takes some time to do
    it right."

    about switching keys round only to find two keys were different in shape so making
    the task impossible as I'd have to miss 4 keys out due to incompatibility.\r\n\r\nI
    guess its for the best as you point out."

    left the keys in the QWERTY layout, since I don't often look at the keys.  I know

  content: "I have considered switching to Dvorak layout many times, but I just never
    really had the time.\r\n\r\nI think the efficiency will be a big payoff, at least
    for English.  Programming languages, maybe not so much.\r\n\r\nQWERTY is just
    so engrained in my memory and now I'm getting old and slow, perhaps it's too much
    trouble.\r\n\r\nI am also a \"keyboardist\" of the piano and synthesizer variety,
    so I do have greater finger awareness and dexterity than most.  But since typing
    is less stimulating to my keen ears, it is not nearly as motivating.\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    I found this site because I quickly realized the annoyance of all my keyboard
    shortcuts getting screwed up.  The current shortcut/mousing system is more efficient.
    \ I suffer more from mousing strain than keying strain (probably because I mouse
    more) so I don't want to revert to \"hunt and click\"....worse than hunt and peck
    when you're faced daily with screens full of options to select"

    QWERTY.  But even so, I'd say try it.  If you find your QWERTY muscle memory slipping,
    switch back, and it shouldn't take too long for it to return.  You may find yourself

  content: "I've been palying with Dvorak for a few days now. I really like the feel,
    and actually the learning curve is one of my favourite things about it. \r\n\r\nBut
    so far, I haven't been able to fix some details that vex me quite a bit: I use
    a VX Revolution mouse, and I have the copy and paste functions assigned to a couple
    buttons. Well, it behaves very weirdly in Firefox. The copy brings up the downloads
    window, whose shortcut is Ctrl+J, and that would make sense because the J is where
    the C would be in QWERTY. But I have found all the other shortcuts work normally,
    and I have found no fix yet, even testing deeply with layout modifications (using
    Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator). I shall mention I use a spanish version, and
    the mouse works flawlessly in the English Dvorak.\r\n\r\nWhat really sucks at
    this point is all the obstacles I find to be able to make full use of better input
    devices, because I don't feel like going back to QWERTY. \r\n\r\nNice blog by
    the way."

  content: "Thanks for the thoughts and for sharing your experiences.  It may be due
    to never developing more than a relatively speedy six finger, non-touch based
    style on Qwerty but I personally found Dvorak comfortable and easy to learn in
    less than a week.  Something about the way the layout is arranged just feels pleasing
    to me.  \r\n\r\nI was thinking of trying Colemak but some of the design philosophies
    put me off, especially the similarities to Qwerty. Also while the repurposed caps
    lock as a second delete key is a very popular trait of the layout but I believe
    it may foster poor accuracy in the long run.\r\n\r\nAs for the issues with cut-copy-paste
    hot keys, I just assign the functions to the f13-f15 keys which sit separately
    from the main function keys above the home, delete and page up/down cluster on
    my keyboard.  This eliminates the problem of accidentally closing windows when
    pasting."

    time.  i got a screwdriver out and changed all the keys around, only took about
    2 mins ( http://twitpic.com/50qyw ). i was a pretty proficient qwerty typer -
    about 100wpm.  right now i'm at about 20-30wpm on dvorak.  i work in IT so i have
    to work on qwerty PCs all the time and as far as i can tell i'm still at full
    speed on them.  as someone above mentioned, sometimes while typing on dvorak i
    just slip back into qwerty mode and everything just goes wrong.. i put it down
    to mental tiredness.\r\ni'm going to stick with it for the moment, from my very
    unscientific tests i'm slowly getting faster.  The shortcuts thing is definitely
    my most sore spot, i might try the mouse trick as i have the logitech revolution
    mouse as well, but i usually try and keep my hands off the mouse.\r\n\r\njust
    thought i'd add my bit :)\r\n\r\ni wish i could find somewhere that would sell

  content: "To answer a couple unanswered questions: Macs, both OS X, and the previous
    versions, switch the keyboard system-wide. Under OS X, you have the choice whether
    to make it system-wide, or app-specific; it's been long enough since i used System
    7/8/9 that I don't remember if you also had the option of doing it per-application.
    \r\n\r\nAlso, for Macs there is a Dvorak keyboard layout that leaves command-keys
    in their qwerty locations. So, hitting the key labeled with a 'z' on the physical
    keyboard gives you a semicolon, and hitting shift-z, option-z, and shift-option-z
    all give the appropriate characters that go along with the semicolon normally.
    But if you type command-z, you don't get whatever command-semicolon would invoke
    in your app (often the preferences), but instead it invokes Cut. I'm not sure
    i'm explaining it well? Basically, pressing any key in conjunction with the command
    key matches the result you'd expect from looking at the printed keycaps on your
    qwerty keyboard, but anything else you do instead gives you Dvorak-ish results.
    So if your mental command mappings are more about muscle memory than letter associations,
    that could be a good option. Personally, I think of the letters, so found that
    more confusing than having the command keys in \"funny\" places. No idea if there
    is an equivalent key mapping for MSWindows or *nix.\r\n\r\nAs for switching and
    accommodating: I think the usual claims of re-learning time are optimistic. At
    my best, I was around 120+wpm on qwerty--and that was on a manual typewriter,
    so that meant without typos. By the time i switched to Dvorak, i was probably
    only typing 100wpm. Nonetheless, i would guess that it was a solid 3mo before
    i was back up to my old speed on Dvorak, and probably 3mo more before it was completely
    transparent, and I no longer even noticed. Maybe I'm a slow learner. \r\n\r\nNonetheless,
    I'd never go back, and never even contemplated it at the time. It's just too much
    better. I think the speed claims may be overrated, but the efficiency claims definitely
    play out in my experience, and i get much less sore with lengthy typing. \r\n\r\nOh,
    and I found this because of problems with Dvorak and Vista: not only is it per-application,
    which drives me batty, but it keeps switching back to qwerty at random times,
    like with each new dialog box or text field or anywhere else I might want to type.
    I don't have administtrative rights on the work computer, but i may have to see
    if i can get them to install the dvorak assistant."

  content: "Well, I normally don't post on websites, but this is a good site that
    is closely related to my interests.\r\n\r\nI had a lot of trouble switching to
    Dvorak, and it was a compromise to be sure. I wanted to do a cording keyboard
    as I have a background in piano and guitar, but found that those keyboards were
    to expensive and often large. (I have a small work area.)\r\n\r\nIt took me about
    4 months to master Dvorak and it was hard being a touch typist that thought words
    rather then letters, AND I also did some SQL (now PostgreSQL.)  \r\n\r\nI found
    a way around working on other people's computers. I bought a TypeMatrix keyboard
    after about 6 months of Dvorak, and it took another 1-3 months to master. But
    I still can type about 60 words a minute on a regular keyboard in Dvorak mode,
    after a bit (it take a bit for my brain to switch... 30 mins to an hour)\r\n\r\nSometimes
    I just switch a Vista keyboard to Dvorak if I am going to be using it for more
    than 30 minutes. But if not, I will just type in QWERTY and look at the keys.
    \ The fingers can type just as fast, it just takes a second to translate where
    they go.\r\n\r\nI type only about 70 words a minute even in Dvorak, but it is
    easier for me, and less strain on my wrists. I still use QWERTY from time to time
    and if I look at the keyboard I can type about 30 words a minute which is not
    to bad for little things.\r\n\r\nThe TypeMatrix is nice with it's middle enter
    key and such... I have not beeen able to afford the new one which looks even better
    (I have the 2020)...\r\n\r\nSome notes on the 2020: to use the numeric keypad
    you have to hit caps lock and numlock (in Linux)...\r\n\r\nTo get around the programming
    issue (which I only do on my computer normally) I have remapped somethings and
    use alt chains for some others. (pull down combos)\r\n\r\nSome things that still
    stump me... when I am in Vista on my wife's computer Dvorak is not recognized
    in the command line (I of course can switch it manually if I have my TypeMatrix
    hooked up)\r\n\r\nAnyway, even though I normally use the TypeMatrix, and I am
    typing this on a QWERTY regular keyboard in Dvorak mode. I still am doing about
    30 WPM... mostly because I keep hitting k instead of X in TypeMatrix (because
    in the TypeMatrix keyboard it is not as much of a reach.)\r\n\r\nJonathan..."

I've been a Dvorak typist for about five months.  It took me three tries to really stick it out through the learning phase, because let me tell you—as a touch typist, any learning curve over one week sucks (and you're probably not learning Dvorak if you're a hunt-and-peck-er).  There are some things I wish I knew before I switched, so I'm feeding them to Google for others to find.  My thoughts reflect only my experience, <span class="caps">YMMV</span>, and all that.  For me, the short answer is that I'll probably switch back to <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>.  **Update:** I never actually did, and I'm considering writing a recant to this post.  See the bottom of the post...

## How Bad is the Learning Curve?


I suspect this really varies from person to person—I've [read](http://www.mwbrooks.com/dvorak/training.html) "Allow for about 1 hour of training for each <span class="caps">WPM</span> to regain your old <span class="caps">QWERTY</span> speed".  I don't know my old <span class="caps">QWERTY</span> speed, but I was proficient, so let's say it was 70 <span class="caps">WPM</span>.  If I "trained" all day, that's 70 hours / 8 working hours  = 8.75 days, almost two weeks.  I really type only about a third of the day, so that makes it 8.75×3 = 26.25 days, about five weeks.  In reality, it took me about two months to type without thinking.  Maybe I was faster at <span class="caps">QWERTY</span> than I thought, or maybe I'm a slow learner, but it took me longer to transition than I'd expected.

That may be because I type largely from muscle memory.  Instead of mentally spelling out each word, then finding the corresponding keys, I rely on automatic keystroke patterns for common words (I suspect most touch-typists do this).  This is especially true for keywords in programming languages: table, div, span;  class, public, void, String;  select, from, where, join.  When I started learing Dvorak, my muscle memory for different languages had to be re-learned.  Maybe this made it harder for me to feel comfortable with Dvorak, to really say "ok, I've _learned_ it."  <span class="caps">HTML</span> was the worst, for some reason.  I was re-learning <span class="caps">SQL</span> at the time, and didn't have much <span class="caps">SQL</span> muscle memory, so I picked it up much faster.

## Living with Dvorak


So now that I've arrived, it's keyboard bliss, right?  Almost.  I do like it better, and can definitely feel the difference, but there are some real problems with it, which basically boil down to incompatibility.  I hate to say it, but like Betamax vs. <span class="caps">VHS</span>, the inferior solution wins, by sheer ubiquity.

### Keyboard Shortcuts


Of all the issues, this hit me hardest, being something of a power-user.  On Windows, a bunch of useful commands are conventionally tied to the same keyboard shortcuts, generally with the Ctrl key.  Ctrl+X is cut (like scissors).  C is Copy.  V is paste (the v points down - "put it down here").  Z is undo (I don't know why that makes perfect sense to me).  A is select All.  S is Save.  B is Bold text.  On <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>, those are all left-hand, contiguous keys - mousing with my right hand, I could edit really fast.

All this changed with Dvorak.  The left-handed Ctrl shortcuts are now scattered across the board.  I don't want to re-bind them in every app I use, and in some apps, I couldn't if I wanted to.  I got around this by buying a fancy mouse (a Logitech <span class="caps">MX400</span>) with extra buttons, and tied them to Copy and Paste.  It's not the same, but it solves 70 or 80% of the problem.

### Using Other Computers


This one is bigger than I'd thought.  I know, you're thinking "How often does he use someone else's computer?"  But <span class="caps">QWERTY</span> computers are everywhere, and they're spreading.  Most kiosks and embedded devices use <span class="caps">QWERTY</span> (the rest use alphabetical order).  SmartPhones use <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>.  The TitleSleuths at Borders bookstores use it.  Even my Prius uses it.  Lots of devices offer keyboards to talk to them, and they're not supporting Dvorak.  The range of devices that I've become incompatible with is only growing.

### Other People Using My Computer


This is a minor point.  Everytime someone wants to use my computer (pair programming, or whatever), I have to switch it to <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>, for _each application_ they use…it's not global (is this any better on Macs or *nix?).  So I launch an app and give them the keys, but they're only OK until they launch something else.  And some apps you need to tell twice, most notably the command line.  You tell it "Dvorak", it says <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>.  "Dvorak".  <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>.  "No, dammit, _Dvorak!_"

You can get around this with the excellent [Dvorak Assistant](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8799), a little System tray tool, whose icon is either a Q or a D key.  Instead of mousing around with the Win XP Language Toolbar, you can switch layouts via Ctrl+Shift+F12—much better than WinXP's default, Ctrl+Left Alt.  I used to mash that combo all the time, and sure enough, it'd pop me right into <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>.  Even better, the Dvorak Assistant affects all apps at once.

## Switch back to <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>?


Like I said earlier, I'll probably switch.  My slightly-better speed comes at the cost of compatibility with the rest of the world.  My Dvorak speed will continue to improve some, and eventually plateau, but the number of <span class="caps">QWERTY</span> keyboards around me will only increase.  This makes Dvorak a steadily growing liability.

It'll take a bit to re-train my muscle memory, but I believe it'll be much faster than learning Dvorak.  Back on <span class="caps">QWERTY</span>, I'll be able to use any keyboard that crosses my path, and I'll get all those keyboard shortcuts back.  I'll have to make those extra mouse buttons do something else.

## UPDATE


**2007-02-23** So I still haven't switched back to QWERTY.  I've tried a few times, and it doesn't seem like it'll be _too_ hard to do, but I'm lazy, and busy doing other things.  On the other hand, if it's easy enough to switch to QWERTY, I might opt instead to stay on Dvorak, and just periodically practice QWERTY.  That way, I'll have the best of both worlds.

Also, someone found this article by searching for Vista + Dvorak.  I'll try to test the Dvorak Assistant on Vista, and will let everyone know how it goes, unless someone posts with a more specific question.

## UPDATE (again)


**2009-01-24** Somewhere in the two years since I last updated this, I decided to stay on Dvorak.  Reading over my reasons for switching back to QWERTY, they boil down to three: crappy Windows support, other people and computers, and hot-keys.

Crappy Windows support is 100% solved by the still-excellent [Dvorak Assistant](http://www.clabs.org/blogki/index.cgi?page=/ComputersAndTechnology/DvAssist) -- I carry a copy on my thumbdrive, and it's on every machine I regularly use.  If I could pay for it, I would.  It works flawlessly on Vista.

Other people and computers is still an issue, but only a minor one.  I can comfortably hunt-and-peck QWERTY, so using any other machine (kiosk, TitleSleuth, or my Prius) is simple enough.  Even since I started pair-programming _all the time_ at my new job, it hasn't been a problem -- the Dvorak Assistant lets me switch my machine when we're at my desk, and I can find my way around QWERTY easily enough at other people's machines.

Hot-keys have become less of an issue as I've gotten more used to life with Dvorak.  I'm used to using hot-keys where they are in Dvorak (Ctrl-S looks like Ctrl-semi-colon), because when I type them, I still think in terms of letters: "S for Save", and for me, it's still an S.
