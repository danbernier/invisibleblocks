I often hear people mis-use the words _accuracy_ and _precision_, but they mean different things.

To say I'm 117 years, 93 days, 4 hours, 17 minutes, and 48.249 seconds old is very precise, but it's inaccurate (right now, anyway).  To say I'm in my thirties is accurate, but imprecise.  Precision is about level of detail, accuracy is about truthiness.

They make a wonderful pair, working pretty much orthogonally to each other.

Wikipedia has <a title="Accuracy and Precision" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy#Accuracy_versus_precision.3B_the_target_analogy">a nice analogy using a bulls-eye target</a>.
