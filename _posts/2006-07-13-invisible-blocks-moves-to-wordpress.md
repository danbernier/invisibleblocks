Here's the [new RSS feed](http://invisibleblocks.wordpress.com/feed/).  JavaScript redirects should bring everyone over to the new site.  Please let me know at danbernier - at - gmail if you find anything wrong.

After about 18 months at [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com), I decided to look for something better.  I've been playing with [WordPress](http://www.wordpres.com) for about a month, and like it a lot:

* Editing is easier, especially for code.
* It seems to save and publish faster.
* The sidebar is easy to customize, and it requires no mucking with the blog template.  In fact, you _can't_ muck with the template, which only seems like a drawback until you consider my graphic design skills.
* You can upload small files (I still have to play with this) -- perfect for code examples.
* It has categories, pages, and built-in blog statistics.
* It imported my entire blog in only a few minutes.  Sweet...
