I'm happy to say the code is getting much better.  This presents some new information to my thinking about off-shoring...

Along those lines, while I was at [OOPSLA](http://www.oopsla.org/2005/ShowPage.do?id=Home) (I know, I didn't post anything from there yet -- getting to it), I talked with a developer from Holland whose company outsources regularly to Romania. Apparently, he gets much better code than our initial batch -- he wasn't worried about code quality, and even talked about leaving things for his developers to finish designing, so they don't get bored. This sounds like a much healtier working relationship. I plan on emailing him soon to talk more.
