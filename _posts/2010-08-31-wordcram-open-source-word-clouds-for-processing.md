I just released a project I've been working on for a while, called [WordCram](http://wordcram.org).  As the title says, it's a Processing library for generating word clouds.

I found [wordle.net](http://wordle.net) a few years ago and really liked it, and after seeing the code for Algirdas Rascius' [Scattered Letters](http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=1811) on OpenProcessing.org, I tried making [some of my own](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bonsai_giant/tags/wordle/).  It was fun, but I thought it ran too slowly to bother bundling it into a Processing library.

After reading the [Wordle chapter](http://blog.wordle.net/2010/05/wordle-as-beautiful-visualization.html) from [Beautiful Visualization](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449379869?ie=UTF8&tag=invisblock-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449379869), I learned a few new tricks, and it's a bit faster now, so here it is.  There's still work to do, but that's the fun part.
