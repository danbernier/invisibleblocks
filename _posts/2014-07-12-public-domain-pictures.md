Maybe old news, but news to me: 4 collections of photos in the public domain, and they're not too bad:

* [PublicDomainPictures.net](http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/)
* [Public-Domain-Photos.com](http://public-domain-photos.com/)
* [Photos-Public-Domain.com](http://www.photos-public-domain.com/)
* [Public-Domain-Image.com](http://www.public-domain-image.com/)

Now this blog posts looks like it was generated by a spam-bot. :(

I haven't delved too deeply into these yet, but I will be in the future.
