The [Hartford Ruby Group](http://groups.google.com/group/hartford-ruby-brigade) is meeting this Monday, 11/24, from 6 - 8 PM.

[Flinn Mueller](http://www.actsasflinn.com/) will be talking about [rspec](http://rspec.info/), and we'll hopefully hear stories from the [Voices that Matter](http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/) attendees.

We'll raffle off [The Professional Ruby Collection: Mongrel, Rails Plugins, Rails Routing, Refactoring to REST, and Rubyisms CD](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132417995?ie=UTF8&tag=invisblock-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0132417995).

GeeZeo offices
750 Main St, Hartford
Suite 1314

Thanks to GeeZeo for hosting us, to Sun for feeding us, and to Addison Wesley for giving us books to raffle off.  Hope to see you there!
