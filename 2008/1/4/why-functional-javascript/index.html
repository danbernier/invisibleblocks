    <h1 class="post-title">Why Functional JavaScript?</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Jan 4, 2008 • Dan Bernier</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’m teaching myself functional programming (FP).  I first noticed it in Ruby, even though it’s been in JavaScript all along.  I’m working my way through <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> (SICP), and <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">The Little Schemer</a> books, so I’m learning Scheme and Lisp too.</p>

<p>When studying FP, I generally use JavaScript and Scheme.  My FP examples here are usually in JavaScript:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s available everywhere, and most programmers are comfortable reading it.</li>
  <li>It’s closer to Scheme than Ruby is, so the examples translate better.  In fact, Douglas Crockford <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/little.html">notes</a>:  “JavaScript has much in common with Scheme. It is a dynamic language. It has a flexible datatype (arrays) that can easily simulate s-expressions. And most importantly, functions are lambdas.  Because of this deep similarity, all of the functions in The Little Schemer can be written in JavaScript.”</li>
</ul>

<p>I include Ruby or Scheme, though, if it seems appropriate.</p>

<p>I often use the <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/shell/shell.html">JavaScript Shell</a>, or its big brother, the <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/jsenv/">JavaScript Development environment</a>, because I haven’t found or built a JavaScript REPL as nice as <a href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/software/drscheme/">Dr. Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Most current JavaScript implementations are slow with <a href="http://www.kirit.com/Recursive%20rights%20and%20wrongs">recursion</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/01/04/ie-jscript-performance-recommendations-part-3-javascript-code-inefficiencies.aspx">closures</a>…two cornerstones of functional programming.</p>

<p>I don’t worry about this, because my examples are not meant to be dropped into production systems without thought and testing.  I write production-ready code at work; here, I play and explore.  We do use some functional JavaScript where I work, but it’s where the performance is acceptable, and the imperative alternative would be too unwieldly.</p>

<p>History seems to show that performance is a short-term concern, and better programming techniques are a long-term concern.  It also seems that there are no inherent reasons JavaScript is slow; more performant implementations may be in our future.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-haskell-or-erlang">Why not Haskell or Erlang?</h3>

<p>…or OCaml, Scala, F#, Clojure?  I’m getting there.  SICP and The Little Schemer books are more than enough for me right now.</p>

<p>http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/</p>

<p>Many of the delightful goodies of langauges like Haskell (partial application, currying, composition, point-free programming, and so forth) in a compact Javascript library. It now plays nicely with Rhino.</p>

    <div><p>I’ve seen it, but haven’t had the chance to dive in yet.  Just from the front page, it looks like it could serve as a syllabus for further exploration into functional programming…thanks for passing it on!</p>

    <div><p>Daniel, great post. I have gone from loathing Javascript to really enjoying using it, in large part because I have discovered its functional programming potential. Getting to know the proptotype.js code helped me explore that. Doing a lot of Ajax and event handling coding made me familiar with first-class procedures.</p>

<p>I too am working through SICP, through the MIT OpenCourseWare course of the same name, with a few other brave souls. I read the Little Schemer last year, and it really helped prepare me for a lot of the concepts in SICP.</p>

<p>Good luck with functional Javascript. I’ll keep an eye on your feed, and I look forward to reading more about your explorations.</p>

    <div><p>If you are going to do any of the examples in SICP book, I would be curious how you will do a metacircular evaluator (chapter 4, I believe).  I guess that will not be necessary if you are strictly doing functional programming in Javascript, but I would be interested in seeing what you come up with. :-)</p>

    <div><p>@goodmike, I’ve been using the SICP 1981 lectures, but I might check out the MIT stuff…that’s a great idea, I can’t believe it didn’t occur to me.</p>

<p>@Ralph, when I get that far, I’ll certainly do the metacircular evaluator in Scheme.  Maybe I’ll give it a go in JavaScript too, though, and see how far I get.  My point in this post was really to say “when I <em>blog</em> about FP, the examples are in JavaScript, because…”  I’ve come to enjoy Scheme, and I’ll keep my eye open for ways to use it on-the-job, but JavaScript is generally an easier sell.</p>

<p>@Mark, I’ve never heard of MozRepl, I’ll check it out.  There’s probably an emacs hacker inside me, waiting to come out; MozRepl is one more reason for me to seriously sit down with it.  I expect it’ll pay off, but it’s always a question of how to use my scarce time: FP?  blogging?  linux?  emacs?  The autodidact’s curse is that you never really graduate.</p>
